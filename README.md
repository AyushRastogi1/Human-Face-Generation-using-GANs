# Human-Face-Generation-using-GANs

This project defines and trains a Generative Adverserial Network (GAN) on a dataset of faces. A modified CelebA dataset is used for training. A data pipeline consisting of data transformation and data loaders is created. Multi-layer generator and discriminator architectures are defined. Multiple loss types and gradient penalties are implemented. The resulting GAN is trained to generate images of new human faces.
